    th:text -> The th:text attribute in Thymeleaf is used to set the text content of an element.
    th:if -> In some situations, you want a certain snippet of the Thymeleaf template to appear in the result if a certain condition is evaluated as true. To do this you can use the attribute th:if.
th:each -> Thymeleaf th:each is an attribute used for iteration in Thymeleaf templates. It can iterate over different data types, including: Iterable, Map , Arrays

 th:switch /  th:case -> In Java, you are familiar with the switch/case structure. Thymeleaf also has a similar structure that is th:switch/th:case.
If there are more than two possible results of an expression, we can use the th:switch and th:case attributes for the conditional rendering of the HTML elements.
